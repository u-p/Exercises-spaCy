# (a)
# Import the English language class and create the nlp object

# Select the first token

# (b) Lexical attributes: Use spaCy's Doc and Token objects, and lexical attributes to find percentages in a text.
# Use the like_num token attribute to check whether a token in the doc resembles a number.

# Process the text
